## Tools and Frameworks
- *Cucumber*: Used for Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) to write human-readable test scenarios.
- *Playwright*: A modern test automation framework for reliable, fast, and scalable UI testing.

## Project Details
- *API Testing*: A provided JAR file was used for testing.

## Features
- *BDD Approach*: We wrote Gherkin scenarios for clear and understandable test cases.
- *Page Object Model (POM)*: Organized UI test scripts for maintainability and scalability.
- *CI/CD Integration*: Used for automated test runs.
